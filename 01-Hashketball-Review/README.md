* Distinguish between data types in Ruby
* Show how to look up documentation for data types in Ruby
* Demonstrate the use of common Array methods
  * `#each` => do something on every value in the array; always returns the original array
  * `#map`
  * `#select`
  * `#find` => finds things in an array; always returns some thing (either the found value or nil)
* Differentiate array methods by their respective return values
* Define the Single Responsibility Principle
* Employ test-driven development best practices in their labs
  * `rspec --fail-fast` handle one error at a time
  * Red, Green, Refactor
  * Make it work (shameless green), make it right, make it fast
